					<h3>My name is Andres Barreras, and I am an aspiring Software Developer.</h3>
                    <h4>On the personal side, I enjoy hobbies such as: Hiking, Reading, Watching Movies, and Video Games. In addition to my hobbies I also spend my free time organizing and running the Dungeons & Dragons ERG Group I started at Road to Hire, and some volunteer work at the Daniel Stowe Botanical Garden. </h4>
                    <h4>On the professional side of things I have started the Road to Hire Program back in November of 2021, and since I've started with the program I have learned to work with technologies such as: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, MySQL, & React. Though I have only recently transitioned to the tech industry career wise I have always had an interest in technology and am hoping to transition into a full time position upon ending the program.  </h4>
